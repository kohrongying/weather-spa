# Weather SPA

Built with [single-spa](), React and Svelte.

It was my attempt at learning microfrontends. I ended up rendering two different frameworks in a single page application. Microfrontend? Not too sure anymore. But it was still a good venture.

## Development
```
npm run install

npm run start
```

## Deployment
nil
